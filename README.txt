ISTE340 Client Programming
Project 2: jQuery & working with RIT API

Plug-ins
1. nav bar help hover (can only see it when at the top of the page, not sure why)
2. employers randomizer (fades in and out)
3. people hover (gives user more information about staff selected)

I included 3 jQuery plug-ins, stated above and within my index.html file.
I wanted to recreate the entire look and feel of the RIT website so I opted
for a more moder/swedish-modernist interpretation. I believe that I succeeded 
in doing so (I'm currently in a design class and I learned about this style so
I wanted to experiment/physically implement it through my web design).

It was fairly difficult trying to get the alignment and positioning right for 
certain sections, especially for the sections dedicated to degrees and people. 
Dealing with the Graduate Advanced Certificates also was a struggle and took me 
a little bit of time to figure out.

The people's section is nicely implemented because it's responsive. If you scale 
your window to a larger width, the row of "people" cards increase, and vice versa.
